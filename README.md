# Web-Performance-Metrics

Collection of raw and UX metrics for web front-end performance measurement with prioritisation hints.

## What is this project?
This project is a list of measurable metrics to help website owners, developers, maintainers when discussing
website performance issues.
Each metric has a name, a technical and a "plain English" descriptive summary to help either technical and
non-technical people exactly understand what it is.

Too many performance conversations fail because the communication between the parties is too generic.
- "The website is slow"
- "No, It's fast! the DOM is loaded in 0.2 seconds"
All parties need some help to define exactly what is being discussed, especially as modern websites grow, and
there are so many components, plugins, pixel trackers, ads that contribute to making large websites slow.

The first step is to identify what part of the website feels slow, what are the most annoying parts, so that
website developers and performance consultants can best help optimising and talk about exact metrics that can be
measured, reported, and compared to prove their truth.

The following metrics are grouped in 2: loading and interaction metrics.
The former measure the page's initial loading performance, whilst the latter anything that comes after, mainly in
response to user interaction.

## Loading metrics

### M1 - Initial Paint (Priority: low)
The browser's initial paint event.
Some content above the fold is displayed for the first time, which may be only limited to:
- containers (div, table elements, etc)
- image placeholders
- headlines or paragraphs with known-to-the-browser fonts

### M2 - DOMContentLoaded (Priority: medium)
No elements are being resized, moved or re-aligned anymore by static CSS.
All text is rendered with the correct local or downloaded font.
Any images occupy their final size as defined by HTML or CSS. Scripts may still change content subsequently. 

### M3 - Initial Layout Settlement (Priority: medium)
Content above the fold is changed for the last time.
#### M3a Content above the fold is changed for the last time.
No elements are being resized, moved or re-aligned anymore (not by any JavaScript handlers, or dynamically injected CSS).
Images may be still loading, but occupy space in their defined slot that will not change anymore.
No adverts or other lazy-loaded elements are causing layout changes.

### M4 - Initial Position Settlement (Priority: medium)
The browser has finished scrolling to the last position when a "back" or "refresh" button have been pressed, either because of HTML/CSS reflow or JavaScript scrollTo() calls.

### M5 - Above-the-fold Load (Priority: high)
All content above the fold is fully displayed, including images.

### M6 - Load
The Browser "load" event (Priority: medium)
All static content is fully loaded, including images below the fold.
Lazy-loaded images may not have been loaded at this stage.

### M7 - Network Settlement
Browser loading spinner stops. (Priority: low)
All initial HTTP requests have been served.
Network sockets may still be open but there are no pending connections.
Exceptions:
- Long-poll requests and Websockets may still be open.
- Web analytics tracking requests may still be firing from time to time.
- Video streaming connections may still remain open, or new ones may open.
- Network requests fired from post-load and interactive event handlers (e.g.: setTimeout, onclick) do not count here.

##Early Interaction metrics
### M8 - Initial Scroll settlement (Priority: high)
Page can be first scrolled at a high frame rate (60fps or the maximum allowed by the browser/device).
Beware that if the user scrolls very slowly, the reported refresh rate may be less than 60fps because less paints are actually required. That is not a performance bottleneck.

## Late Interaction metrics
### M9 - Framerate delay caused by non-passive scroll event listeners (Priority: high)

### M10 - Subsequent Scroll settlement (Priority: high)
Page can be scrolled at a high frame rate again, after interaction handling is completed.
- E.G.: user clicks a button that loads content causing layout/paint.
- E.G.: user scrolls the page or resizes the window which causes layout/repaint, adverts and embedded content refreshed.
Beware that if the user scrolls very slowly, the reported refresh rate may be less than 60fps because less paints are actually required. That is not a performance bottleneck.
